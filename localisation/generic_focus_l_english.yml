    #Global continuous focus descriptions
    continuous_air_production_desc:0 "We can reorganize our aviation industry to eliminate waste and streamline production."
    continuous_boost_freedom_desc:0 "By reorganizing our colonial bureaucracy and recruiting native administrators, we will, in time, be able to take charge of our own affairs."
    continuous_naval_production_desc:0 "By focusing resources on our shipyards and exempting skilled shipbuilders from military service, we can dramatically reduce production time for ships."
    continuous_non_factory_construct_desc:0 "There is still a lot of slack in our construction industry. By focusing our attention on it, we can achieve a significant improvement in construction speed. Unfortunately, the production of machine tools has proven a major bottleneck in the expansion of our heavy industry, so they won't benefit from efforts in this area."
    continuous_reduce_training_time_desc:0 "By creating specialized advanced training units within each division, we can deploy even divisions that would previously have been held back to finish training to the front."
    continuous_repair_desc:0 "We will form specialized repair teams from factory and construction workers and centrally control their deployment to improve reconstruction of damaged infrastructure."
    continuous_restrict_freedom_desc:0 "Our colonial subjects have gotten rather silly ideas about things like "self-determination" or "national independence". It is time to disabuse them of these notions."
    continuous_suppression_desc:0 "By infiltrating the major resistance groups in occupied territory and turning their leaders, we can significantly reduce the amount of damage they can do."
    continuous_tech_share_desc:0 "We will encourage our research institutes and universities to reach out to their counter parts in allied countries. This will gain us a tech sharing bonus."
