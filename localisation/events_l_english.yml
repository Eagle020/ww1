 serbia.19.d2: "Serbian diplomats have requested an urgent meeting with [Root.GetLeader] in [Root.Capital.GetName].

 serbia.24.d: "As our military is continuing to mobilize for the coming war, we are still in need of a formal reason to invade - an ultimatum, issued by us and rejected by the Serbian government would be convenient.\n\nThe remaining question is how harsh the presented terms need to be to achieve this goal, while not upsetting other nations too much."

 serbia.26.d1: "Today, the Austro-Hungarian government has presented us with an ultimatum - their terms are so harsh they have cost them much international sympathy: they are demanding, amongst other things, the abdication of [SER.GetLeader] and his entire dynasty and that we cede them our capital of Belgrade together with half our territory."
 serbia.26.d2: "Today, the Austro-Hungarian government has presented us with an ultimatum - their harsh terms have cost them some international sympathy: they are demanding, amongst other things, that we accept Austro-Hungarian police to conduct investigations on our territory, effectively turning us into an Austro-Hungarian client state."
 serbia.26.d3: "Today, the Austro-Hungarian government has presented us with an ultimatum - the terms they are offering seem rather mild: we are to extradit anyone suspected to have aided the conspirators to Austria-Hungary, including several high-ranking officers in the Serbian army."
 serbia.26.d4: "Today, the Austro-Hungarian government has presented us with an ultimatum: we are to extradit anyone suspected to have aided the conspirators to Austria-Hungary, including several high-ranking officers in the Serbian army.\n\nWhile the terms seem rather mild, we are risking to expose the extent of our involvement if we agree."
 serbia.26.a: "Do we have a choice?"
 serbia.26.b: "Never!"
 serbia.27.t: "Serbia Accepts"
 serbia.27.d1: "Surprisingly, Serbia has accepted the ultimatum we issued. The Serbian king and his entire dynasty have abdicated and gone into exile, and the new government has also agreed to our territorial demands - Belgrade, the former Serbian capital is now part of our Empire. What remains of the Serbian state will be closely tied to Vienna, ensuring they will never become a threat again."
 serbia.27.d2: "Surprisingly, Serbia has accepted the ultimatum we issued. Allowing Austro-Hungarian personnel to supervise the Serbian investigation on Serbian territory effectively turns Serbia into our client state, eliminating any need for war."
 serbia.27.d3: "Serbia has accepted the ultimatum we issued and extradited the individuals we named them to us, including several high-ranking former officers of the Serbian army.\n\nWhile likely to lead to significant advances for our investigation into the Sarajevo incident, this deprives us of any reason to go to war."
 serbia.27.a1: "Good."
 serbia.27.a2: "Not quite what we hoped for..."
 serbia.28.t: "Serbian Defiance"
 serbia.28.d: "As expected, the Serbian government has rejected our ultimatum - this gives us a reason to declare war on them."
 serbia.28.a: "This is just what we need."
 serbia.28.b: "Perhaps this was a bad idea after all?"
 serbia.29.t: "Join War?"
 serbia.29.d: "Austria-Hungary is at war, and we have promised them our support - however, our army is still mobilizing and will need weeks to reach its full fighting strength."
 serbia.29.a: "Join the war regardless."
 serbia.29.b: "We need to properly prepare for this."
 serbia.30.t: "Pro-Serbian Demonstrations"
 serbia.30.d1: "Following the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia, pro-Serbian and increasingly anti-German demonstrations have been regularly held in [Root.Capital.GetName], putting pressure on us to join the war on the Serbian side.\n\nAs the Serbian army, hard pressed by the Austro-Hungarians, is running low on ammunition and at the brink of collapse after weeks of heropic resistance, shall we give in to popular pressure and join the war?"

 serbia.32.d1: "Following our plea for help, [From.GetNameDef] has joined the war on our side. Despite needing more time to properly organize, the [From.GetAdjective] army is expected to soon relieve some of the pressure lasting on our defenses."
 serbia.32.d2: "Following our plea for help, [From.GetLeader] has agreed to join the war on our side once the [From.GetAdjective] army is ready. As moilization in [From.GetNameDef] is expected to take several weeks, we are on our own for now."
 serbia.32.d3: "Following our plea for help, [From.GetLeader] has agreed to allow volunteers to join the fight on our side. While not quite what we hoped for, the men are most welcome in our trenches."
 serbia.32.d4: "Following our plea for help, [From.GetLeader] has agreed to send modern guns and ammunition. While not quite what we hoped for, this will certainly ease the strained supply situation in our trenches."
 serbia.32.a: "Good."
 serbia.32.b: "Not quite what we hoped for..."
 serbia.33.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses to Help"

 serbia.35.d1: "Following repeated visits by Serbian diplomats in [RUS.Capital.GetName], [RUS.GetNameDef] is mobilizing! We are expecting them to join the war on the enemy's side, but it will take weeks until the [RUS.GetAdjective] army is ready.\n\nPerhaps we should seek support from our allies?"

 serbia.39.t: "Nationalist Uprising"
 serbia.39.d: "Unwilling to accept the deal cut in Rome, Austrian nationalists have risen up against our government under the leadership of a local innkeeper. While nominally swearing allegiance to the [AUH.GetLeader], he claims the Italians had bribed leading politicians into abusing the aged Emperor's trust, and that the surrender of Austrian territories was therefore an "unauthorized act of treason" against the Austro-Hungarian state. Several commanders have gone over to the rebels, while the army itself remained mostly loyal."

He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership.

If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."

 political.4.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 political.5.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 political.6.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"

They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t:0 "Fascist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.9.a:0 "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.10.t:0 "Civil War for Fascism"
 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."

 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."

 political.15.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."

 political.17.d:0 "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."

 political.18.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."

The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed.

The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

The discrepacy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."
 stability.21.desc.c:0 "With government responses to draft dodging having no positive effects whatsoever, more and more people have started to wonder why they should put themselves at risk while others stay in safety. Recruits that do turn up often report being harrassed or ridiculed in the streets as fools fighting for a doomed cause.

Some in the government have advocated a sharp military response, followed by a swift execution of the ringleaders as enemy agents and traitors. However, others in the civil service have recommended a more measured approach, pointing out that a heavy-handed response may well backfire if the soldiers involved are not as loyal as we thought they were."
 stability.22.desc.b:0 "Government efforts to convince the strikers to return to work seem to have had no effect whatsoever.

Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."

And the victories of the assembly line should be celebrated just as much as the ones won by the front line."\n\nAll available propaganda resources have been rerouted to show the work of the armaments workers in the best possible light. [Root.GetLeader] has personally approved a new award to be given out for workers who have exceeded their quota by more than 100%, and the first recipients have been sent on tours around the country to instruct other workers in their methods.\n\nIt appears that this has made a lot of the strikers reconsider their stance.

At the same time, the War Office has been authorized to take direct control of any factory that produces goods relevant to the war effort if the leadership of those factories has shown a lack of ability.\n\nThe announcement was met with silent resignation in the affected cities, especially once it was announced that anyone resisting would be treated the same as a soldier who refused to follow orders.

As the sun crept over the horizon and the workers manning the barricades at the factories looked forward to relief by the day shift, the assault columns moved in. The tired workers were sluggish to organize the resistance and quickly overcome. Leaving a small detachment to guard the prisoners, the troops sweept the town, arresting everyone on the list of known factory workers. By noon, the military had taken full control of the cities and instituted a curfew. No further resistence is expected. The majority of workers will soon be released on the condition that they return to work, the ring leaders will be held and put on trial. Death sentences are expected to be handed down."

As the troops moved in, they found the workers alert and ready for them. The first assault broke down in hails of thrown stones. A second assault with fixed bayonets was repulsed in brutal hand-to-hand fighting, leaving dozens of dead and dying in the streets.\n\nThe officers in charge have pulled back to consolidate their forces, while the workers are extending their fortifications and arming themselves with the weapons left behind in the retreat. A second day of fighting is expected tommorrow, but Military High Command does no longer believe that victory is likely."

Military High Command has opted for clemency and assured the mutineers that they would not be punished harshly. A few examples have been made in which some soldiers were demoted to a lower rank and transferred to a different unit."

 mutiny_event.2.desc:0 "Attempts to scare the mutineers into submission have backfired spectacularly as the troops showed little fear of the units sent to supress them. Using skills honed on the front lines, they quickly organized a defense of their positions that would make any attempt to defeat them very costly. \n\nThe officers in charge of the loyalist units have pulled back and are awaiting further orders, but this small success has no doubt strengthened the mutineers' resolve."

Fate has decided that we must be at war, to protect our freedom, our homes, our [Root.GetAdjective] way of life! We did not choose this war, it was forced on us! You know that I would not ask anything of you that I would not be willing to do myself, and I know that you will do whatever is necessary to secure victory."\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s speech in front of the troops appears to have had the desired effect, as the soldiers broke out in spontaneous cheers and returned to their duties without more than the usual amount of complaining."
