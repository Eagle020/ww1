No one shall replace our Christian Tsardom!" RUS_kitay_gorod:0 "Kitay Gorod" RUS_kitay_gorod_desc:0 "Kitay Gorod meaning Basket Town in old Russian is a small market district in the center of Moscow.

RUS_primorskaya_railway:0 "Primorskaya Oblast Railway" RUS_primorskaya_railway_desc:0 "After linking most of Siberia with the Trans-Siberian railway we must finish it at the sea.
